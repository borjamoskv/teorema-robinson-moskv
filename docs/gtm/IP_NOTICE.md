## 1. Statutory Notice & IP Status

All software, algorithms, data structures, and architectural specifications within **BABYLON-60** and the **C5-REAL Kernel** constitute **Proprietary Trade Secrets** and original copyrighted works owned by the authors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Legal Status**: While formal patent applications are undergoing technical drafting prior to official submission, all innovations detailed below are protected under international Trade Secret laws (Directive EU 2016/943, US Defend Trade Secrets Act) and Copyright law. Unlicensed reproduction, reverse engineering, or unauthorized commercial deployment is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Patent-Eligible Innovations & Proprietary Claims

The technological moat encompasses four core patent-eligible innovation areas:

### Innovation Area A: Deterministic Sub-Millisecond Lock-Free Shared Memory IPC
* **Technical Scope**: Zero-latency inter-process communication (IPC) executing at sub-5ms bound via bare-metal atomic ring buffers (`repr(C)` ABI alignment) and Lock-Free Epoch-Based Reclamation (EBR).
* **Commercial Vector**: Enables local/Edge execution of real-time validation without cloud overhead, eliminating external network COGS and data egress risks.

### Innovation Area B: Double-Pointer Quarantine Sentinel & Automated Epistemic Fallback
* **Technical Scope**: Automated Ring-0 entropy sentinel mechanism executing atomic CAS (Compare-And-Swap) rollback to fallback memory slots upon detecting statistical drift, semantic variance, or assertion failure within inference windows.
* **Commercial Vector**: **Guaranteed Fail-Stop SLA**. Guarantees system state integrity and zero-downtime quarantine, protecting enterprise applications from stochastic LLM degradation.

### Innovation Area C: Cryptographic Receipt Stream & SCITT-Compatible Immutable Attestation
* **Claim (implemented)**: Asynchronous, non-blocking emission of software-signed attestation receipts for state transitions — SHA3-256 Merkle trees and COSE Sign1 (Ed25519) receipts in SCITT-compatible format (RFC 9942 / RFC 9943) — persisted to a local append-only, tamper-evident ledger, with zero-cost main-thread execution locks.
* **Claim (experimental integration)**: Optional, best-effort anchoring of Merkle roots to public OpenTimestamps calendars via the external `ots` CLI. This produces *pending* (unconfirmed) timestamp proofs, runs fully asynchronously, and is skipped entirely when the `ots` client is not available. It is not part of the guaranteed core runtime.
* **Claim (planned extension / roadmap)**: Bitcoin L1 confirmation of anchored proofs (`ots upgrade` against the Bitcoin chain), registration with a public SCITT transparency service, and hardware-rooted attestation (TPM 2.0). Not part of the current implementation.
* **Commercial Vector**: **Certidumbre Legal & Compliance**. Mathematical proof of compliance for EU AI Act (Article 15/28), SOC 2 Type II, and enterprise DPA audits.

### Innovation Area D: Contractual Liability Cap & Declaratory Containment Engine
* **Technical Scope**: Runtime isolation sandbox enforcing execution boundary conditions and output assertion containment coupled with deterministic risk-budget limits.
* **Commercial Vector**: **Contractual Liability Cap**. Provides verifiable limits allowing enterprise providers to absorb full operational liability.
